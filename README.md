# Pokedex
Simple app for browsing list of available pokemons.

## Installation

`npm i`

## Running
`npm run start`

## TODO
1. App uses custom setup of webpack and react, so few things are missing:
- redux
- unit tests
- react-router
- add eslint
- use CSS Grid to display pokemons on large screens

2. Instead of paging, probably `react-virtualized` could be used.
